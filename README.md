This project will use COVID-19 data and A.I. to make prediction about cases on future days.

> `NOTE`: do `NOT` take predictions given by this project for granted. The accuracy of predictions is `NEVER` 100%. Use these data only to get a general idea.

## About

`OSWALD` name was choosen by dear [Altheatear](https://www.reddit.com/user/Altheatear/). All credits goes to her.

The `Data` is taken from [here](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-cases). Then `parsed` with [Papa Parse](https://www.papaparse.com/), and `feeded` to [ML.js](https://github.com/mljs/ml) for `training`.

Then the `inputs` are linked with `prediction` for `live` results.

Currently, only `recovery` cases (for positivity reasons ðŸ˜‰) are supported. Will add `Death` and `Active` predictions later on.
